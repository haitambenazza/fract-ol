# CONCEPT: 
    a fractal is a geometric shape containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales
# NOTICE:
    -if you are running this on linux you need to download the folder for mlx library in the root of the repo , then change the header file "# include <mlx>" to "# include "./mlx""
    -if you are running this on macos or windows you need to change a lot :( "the path of the library + the keyboard numbers", I might update it
# USAGE:
    -run 'make' to compile the objects
    -run './fractol' with the flags in the menu '1' or '2'
    -run 'make bonus' to compile the objects for burning ship fract
    -run './fractol_bonus' to run the fractal
    -run 'clean or fclean' to delete the programs
